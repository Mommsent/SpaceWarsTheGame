Hi, its my first acceptable project. its top down endless arcade game. When you need to destroy enemys as much as you can, cuple power ups will help you with it.
Start the game you can just click on exe file.
Controllers: Keyboard, Gamepad
Controls for keyboard: Esc - open pause menu, arrow keys or WASD - for chatacter controls, Space - for shooting, Enter - resume.
Controls for gamepad - start - open pause menu, lesft stic or d-pad - for chatacter controls, Y - for shooting, A - resume.
Have a good time!
